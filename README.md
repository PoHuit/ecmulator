# ECMulator
Copyright (c) 2017 Po Huit

There is a lot of confusion about how to calculate jam
probabilities for EVE Online ECM modules. This program
caculates single-cycle jam probabilities for any combination
of ECM modules and drones.

## Usage

Run `python3 ecmulator.py` with appropriate arguments.

* The `--jam` (`-j`) argument specifies a jam module or
  drone, including a repeat count for convenience. The
  module or drone is specified by

  > *\<base-type\>\<variant\>[*`x`*\<count\>]*

  The *count* defaults to 1 if omitted.

  The *base types* are as follows:

  * D: A drone. The *variant* must be one of:

    * 3: EC-300
    * 6: EC-600
    * 9: EC-900

  * M: A multispectral jammer. The *variant* must be one of:

    * 1: T1
    * M: Meta 1
    * 2: T2
    * L: Legion
    * G: Dread Guristas
    * K: Kaikka's
    * T: Thon's
    * V: Vaipas' *[sic]*
    * E: Estamel's

  * R or X: a "matched" or "mismatched" racial jammer,
    respectively. The "matched" case (R) applies the jammer
    to a hull whose sensor type matches the jammer's; the
    "mismatched" case (X) applies the jammer to a hull of
    some other sensor type. The *variant* must be one of:

    * 1: T1
    * M: Meta 1
    * 2: T2
    * S: Storyline [named]
    * L: Legion

* The `--resist` (`-r`) argument specifies the sensor
  strength of the target hull. The default of 20 represents
  an "average" T1 Cruiser hull.

* The `--skill` (`-s`) argument specifies the Signal
  Dispersion skill level of the pilot. Jammer effectiveness
  increases by 5% per level. The default of 5 is what a good
  pilot should have.

* The `--hull` (`-H` â€” don't ask about the uppercase)
  argument specifies the hull bonus percentage (for example,
  `30` for 30%) for jammers. The default of 0 reflects an
  unbonused ship. Hull bonuses must be calculated manually:
  there's too many cases to be specified to make a
  programmatic calculation useful.

* The `--fitting` (`-f`) argument specifies a rig or module
  that affects ECM strength. See the description of `--jam`
  for general syntax. Stacking penalties are applied.

  The *base types* are as follows:

  * S: A Signal Distortion Amplifier module. The *variant*
    must be one of:

    * 1: T1
    * i: Initiated
    * I: Induced *[sigh]*
    * C: Compulsive
    * H: 'Hypnos'
    * 2: T2

  * P: A Particle Dispersion Augmentor rig. The *variant*
    must be one of:

    * 1: T1
    * 2: T2
